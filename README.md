# CaseStudy
The principles my design adheres to are
-Aesthetic and Minimalist design: The product page layout does not contain unnecessary or distracting details making sure the user can focus on the products only leading to lesser cognitive load.
-Consistency and standards: The same fonts are used for each card, the placement of the buttons remains the same as well in order to ease the learnability. The harder it gets for the user to learn your design, the lesser conversion rates it brings in.
-Flexibility and efficiency of use: In this case, the novice user will ideally not know about the different views(i.e.,grid,list) but an expert user would choose their convenient view in order to make quicker decisions. List view is best when pictures are less important and details are more. Allowing users to view their recently viewed items is also one such feature that makes the search more efficient.
Visual hierarchy: The varied fonts for categories,product titles make it easier for the users to understand they are different though in close proximity. Color plays a vital role here as well, which is why the categories are in a different color. Once the user clicks on the category, it should display similar products.
